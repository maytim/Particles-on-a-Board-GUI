Particles-on-a-Board-GUI
========================

My first Qt GUI application. 

This is a basic Qt GUI application that stores string data on a horizontal axis. I practiced using Qt's QGraphicScene and QPainter objects to draw text and shapes, and how to manage mouse events within the QGraphicsScene.
